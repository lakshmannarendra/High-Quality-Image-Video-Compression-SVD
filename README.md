# High-Quality-Image-Video-Compression-SVD
This repository contains a Python implementation of image and video compression using the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) algorithm. The project focuses on compressing images and videos while retaining the maximum possible quality, and explores the trade-off between the number of singular values used and the quality of the reconstructed media.
